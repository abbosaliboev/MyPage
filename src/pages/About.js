              <strong> 2024</strong>, I was selected as a <strong>scholarship intern</strong> at the 
              <strong> Data Analytics Lab (DaLab)</strong> within CBNU. Since <strong>2025</strong>, my major has been 
              officially <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.

            One of my recent projects involved building a real-time AI-based safety monitoring web app.
            I served as both frontend lead and AI engineer. I used React, FastAPI, and YOLOv5 to create a
            system that detects PPE violations in manufacturing environments.
